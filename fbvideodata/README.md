4. **Regular Updates**: Check for application updates regularly for new features
5. **Save Exports**: Export data regularly as Facebook's API may change over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify your access token hasn't expired (they typically last 60 days)
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure the Page ID is correct

2. **No Videos Found**:
   - Confirm the page has public videos
   - Verify you have the correct permissions in your access token
   - Check if the page has restrictions on content access

3. **Missing or Incomplete Metrics**:
   - Some metrics require specific page sizes or minimum activity
   - Verify you're using a Page token rather than a User token
   - Recently published videos may not have complete metrics yet

4. **Google Sheets Export Fails**:
   - Verify your Google API credentials are correct
   - Ensure the service account has permission to create/edit sheets
   - Check that you have an internet connection

5. **Application Crashes**:
   - Check the log tab for error details
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
